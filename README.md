# Deep-Learning: A beginner's course using PyTorch
Deep learning course for beginners. Step by step tutorial using PyTorch.
### 1. Introduction to tensor of pytorch (TP_00)
Get used to with the tensor, finding similarities with numpy, its operation especially autograd at the end.


### 2. Multilayer Perceptron in PyTorch (TP_01)

#### Goal
Learn the basics of PyTorch (PT) by working on an artificial classification problem.

#### Plan
In this tutorial we will create a set of synthetic data that we will use as an example problem.
Then we will create a MLP model and learn its parameters from the data. Finally we will visualize the different learning measures and the parameters of the model.

In a second part we will modify our data and adapt the hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hidden neurons) of our model to allow better classification.

In the next part we will use the basic functions of PT to understand our process and how PT works. But we will also mention the high level features and aids of PT that facilitate our tasks.


#### Usage
 
 * Respond to exercices in the next cells.
 * Write your code in between the lines:
 
```
### BEGIN SOLUTION
